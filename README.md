# Scraping Data
Scraping data from a specified website using beautifulsoup python library

Website used:<br>
https://quotes.toscrape.com/

Required library:<br>
• beautifulsoup4

Expected behavior:<br>
• Create the folder \User\Scraped Data\QuotesToScrape -> This can be changed as you wish at line 80-81, also works cross platform!<br>
• Open the folder that was just created<br>
• Create a folder for each author<br>
• Save all the quotes for the specified author under a file that starts with "quotes_"<br>
• Wait a random amount of time between 2 and 5 seconds before each request so we do not overload the server.
